    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the beef sauce:
            <ul>
                <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Break it into crumbles as
                    it cooks. Remove any excess fat.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet. Sauté until the onion is translucent.</li>
                <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and
                    black pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 20-30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
                    Adjust the seasoning as needed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Cook the Lasagna Noodles:
            <ul>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package
                    instructions until al dente. Drain and rinse them under cold water to prevent sticking.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna:
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of the beef sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>
                <li>Spread a layer of the beef sauce over the noodles, followed by a layer of mozzarella cheese and
                    Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of cheese
                    on top.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bake and Serve:
            <ul>
                <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly,
                    and the lasagna is heated through.</li>
                <li>Let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
                <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves before serving.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
